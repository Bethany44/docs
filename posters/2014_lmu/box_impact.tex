\section*{Impact}
Six years after the beginnings of the project, ObsPy is used by
seismologists all around the world. With \textbf{more than 500 downloads for
Debian/Ubuntu Linux alone}, we estimate -- including Mac, Windows and other
Linux/Unix users -- an \textbf{active user base of around 1000-2000 people}.

Since ObsPy's start by a \textbf{core developer team of 3-5 people} at LMU Munich, ObsPy
has evolved into a community effort with \textbf{contributions to the code base
by 40 individuals}. The \textbf{percentage of contributions from outside the core
developer team is constantly on the rise and is currently at around 40\%}.

The user mailing list currently has over \textbf{300 subscribers} and serves as a
place for discussions and asking for help from more experienced users.

The \textbf{impact of ObsPy and the appreciation within the seismological
community} finds expression in the \textbf{rapidly increasing number of scientific
citations, which stands at over 70 as of October 2014}.
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Around 25 people contributed code so far
