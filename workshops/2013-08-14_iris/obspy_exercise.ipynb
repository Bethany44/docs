Carmel, Illinois, Earthquake and Aftershock Series\n\nIntroduction from \n[\"The April 18, 2008 Illinois Earthquake: An ANSS Monitoring Success\" by Robert B. Herrmann, Mitch Withers, and Harley Benz, SRL 2008](http://srl.geoscienceworld.org/content/79/6/830.extract):\n\n*\"The largest-magnitude earthquake in the past 20 years struck near **Mt. Carmel in southeastern Illinois** on Friday morning, 18 April 2008 at 09:36:59 UTC (04:37 CDT). **The Mw 5.2 earthquake was felt over an area that spanned Chicago and Atlanta**, with about 40,000 reports submitted to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) \u201cDid You Feel It?\u201d system. There were at least six felt aftershocks greater than magnitude 3 and 20 aftershocks with magnitudes greater than 2 located by regional and national seismic networks. **Portable instrumentation was deployed** by researchers of the University of Memphis and Indiana University (the first portable station was installed at about 23:00 UTC on 18 April). The portable seismographs were deployed both to capture near-source, high-frequency ground motions for significant aftershocks and to better understand structure along the active fault.

Adjust it to the dominant event frequency range you have seen in the aftershock spectrogram above. Run a recursive STA/LTA trigger on the filtered data (see [ObsPy docs](https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.stream.Stream.trigger.html)). The length of the `sta` window should be a bit longer than an arriving seismic phase, the `lta` window can be around ten to twenty times as long.\n\nMake a preview plot of the Stream object, now showing the characteristic function of the triggering.

Follow the [example in the ObsPy Tutorial](https://docs.obspy.org/tutorial/code_snippets/xcorr_pick_correction.html).
